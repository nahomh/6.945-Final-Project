; Logic for notes

; We define the logic for the representation of notes here. 

; Spefication Examples:
; (note a) # defaults to fourth octave and duration ¼ if not set or duration of piece
; (note a) -> note a4 duration of ¼
; (note a6) -> note a6 duration of ¼
; (define (piece (new-piece a 4/6)))
; (piece (add-note (note a))) -> note within piece -> note a4 -> duration of ⅙


; (note a ¼)
; (note a 0.25)
; (note a# 0.25)
; (note a# ¼)
; (note a4 0.25)

; Adding a note to a piece
; (piece (add-note (note a)))

; (piece (add-notes a# bb c## d4 ab3 Cb2 d# ebb))
; first letter = note
; second/third/fourth… = flat/sharp
; last = octave
